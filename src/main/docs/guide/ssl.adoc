The Cassandra DataStax Java Driver includes https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/latest/manual/core/ssl/#driver-configuration[support for SSL], to secure traffic between the driver and Cassandra.

This an example of a configuration for Micronaut Cassandra that enables SSL connections. The relevant values are defined under the `cassandra.\*.advanced.ssl-engine-factory.*` property key and documented further in the https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/latest/manual/core/configuration/reference/[Datastax Configuration Reference].

- class: The class of the factory. `DefaultSslEngineFactory` is the default built-in implementation
- cipher-suites: cipher suites to enable when creating a connection
- trust-store and key-store properties: these are optional and if not present the system property configuration is used instead
