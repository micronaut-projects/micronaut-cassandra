The Datastax Cassandra driver is configured using https://github.com/lightbend/config[lightbend/config] under the field `datastax-java-driver.\*`.

The equivalent bean created for micronaut is mapped under the `cassandra.*.*`. fields provided in your `application.conf`, but the bean will fallback on the `datastax-java-driver.\*` values if they are present.

These config values are provided to the https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.4/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/CqlSession.html[CqlSession] under the hood. Datastax does not provide a class that maps to all the various possible config keys, but a full list of values that can be provided can be found in the https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/blob/4.x/core/src/main/java/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/config/DefaultDriverOption.java[DefaultDriverOption enum].

Micronaut Framework is very flexible with how application configuration is specified. Configuration properties can be overridden with environment variables. However, the Cassandra Datastax driver is not tolerant and fails fast when it encounters what it considers malformed/illegal configuration properties. Micronaut Cassandra handles this automatically for most cases, but if you want to use environment variables to override https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/latest/manual/core/configuration/reference/[DataStax driver configuration] they must be uppercase camelcase, e.g. `CASSANDRA_DEFAULT_BASIC_SESSION_NAME`
